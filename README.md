My first commercial and one of the oldest projects here, I created that one in high school using VanillaJS with JQuery. It is a multiplication test for students in primary school.
It was supposed to replicate British National Test that was coming up that year, so students could get more used to the layout.
Numbers aren't fully random, because of the requirements my client gave me, but for a casual user the difference is unnoticable.
The app supports fullscreen and exporting results to CSV file, as well as steering by numerical keyboard and mouse.
